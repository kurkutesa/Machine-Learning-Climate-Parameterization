# Work to do

- Requested more Scratch space to install more packages (e.g. tensorflow-gpu, sklearn, searborn, xarray etc.) in miniconda in the Burn server. (14 Dec 2018) Follow up before holiday.
- Try RF -> NN model.
- Add notes for a) DataStore directory, b) procedures of using virtual environment in Burn server, c) How to run Pascal in my Mac, d) Git command, e) basic *xarray*, f) Tensorboard command etc..
- Automate .py <-> .ipynb conversion.
- Start working on [NN_restore.py](./NN/NN_restore.py).
- (After more disk quota granted), combine RF-NN and use seed 42 for sklearn shuffle for reproducibility.
